    "Ticket Booking Centre -Backend Engineer (Mini project) \n",
    "Statement: \n",
    "There is a Ticket booking centre with C counters which can provide the tickets for the customers. Counter can be in open or closed state.  At start of the day only one counter will be opened and remaining counters will be closed. \n",
    "Each counter can have max queue capacity Q. Counters should be closed immediately once it serves all the customers.  Each counter takes S seconds to process each ticket. Each counter can give only one ticket at a time to any customer.  There are N customers and each customer need T tickets. \n",
    "One person can only take one ticket at a time, if he need another ticket, has to go back to the queue.  \n",
    "People should go to the counter where lesser people are in queue compare to other counters. \n",
    "Given above conditions identify the following things \n",
    "1. Calculate the minimum time required for given N1 customer to collect all its tickets. \n",
    "2. When all open counters queue capacity is full, then identify when new counter need to be opened based on the demand of tickets. 3. Identify when counters made closed after after serving its customer queue \n",
    "Problems to be solved: \n",
    "1. Queue Management \n",
    "2. On Demand Counter addition \n",
    "3. Implement required interfaces(If any) \n",
    "Example: \n",
    "Counter opens at 8:00 AM and will be closed by 8:30 AM. Max counters for this booking centre is 2. The maximum queue capacity of each  counter is 4 and processing each ticket takes 30 secs.
